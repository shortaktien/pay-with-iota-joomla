# IOTA Pay for Joomla

This IOTA plugin works on the basis of the IOTA button https://iota-button.org which can be found here. If you want to read my [developer diary](https://short-aktien.de/iota-pay-wordpress-plugin-spenden-woocommerce/), you should visit my blog.

This plugin lets you easily insert this button anywhere on your Joomla site. Whether in an article, on a page or as a widget.
		
There are 4 entries you need to make: 

		
	The Address
	this is the same as your address in the Firefly app. This is needed so that you can receive your donations and earnings.
		 
	The amount
	here you enter the amount of IOTA you want to receive. It is calculated in the smallest form of IOTA.
		 
	The Currency
	specify here which currency you want to have, in case you want to give people the possibility to convert to USD/EUR for 		 
	example, you will still get your donations and income in IOTA here. The conversion rate will be updated every minute.
		 
	The user
	this input will be necessary for the {donationbtn} button. The users will see who they are donating too. Here you can enter
	your name or the name of your website.
